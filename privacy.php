                            for all personally identifiable information is extremely important to us. We have
                            implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to attempt to protect
                            your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and improper use. We also
                            protect your personally identifiable information offline. Only employees who need the
                            information to perform a specific job (for example, customer service) are granted access to
                            personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally
                            identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. We continually review all such
                            measures and update them when appropriate. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
                            Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your
                            personal information, Company cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
                            transmit via the internet. By transmitting any such information to Company, you accept that
                            you do so at your own risk.</p>
